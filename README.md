# Three Photo Dinner
These receipes are just for making something to eat when you come home after a long day of work or university, are super tired and can't be bothered.

Or maybe you're just lazy. Or can't cook. Or hate it. Or spend too much money going out.

It's by far not the healthiest or most delicious food, certainly nothing for having friends over or for a date. Anyway, it's fast and cheap, who cares.

You can also use these ideas for travelling, especially outdoorsy trips with a single pot, stove and limited storage.
